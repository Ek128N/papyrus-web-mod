Transition labels shall be composed the following way: +
Start with triggers labels separated with comma. Trigger label is the event name or "all" if no event is defined. +
If a guard is defined, add its label between [ ]. Guard label is either a Constraint specification expression if selection is a constraint or and Interaction constraint, or a time expression [1..5] if its a Duration, Interval or TimeConstraint. +
If an effect is defined, add "/" followed byt the effect label. Effect label starts with its kind (Activity, FunctionBehavior, Interaction, OpageBehavior, ProtocolStateMachine or StateMachine) and followed by the referenced element name.
