=== Import Metaclass
This element tool allows to import a UML Metaclass inside the Profile. It can be imported on an Profile Diagram and under a Profile.

==== On Creation
This creation opens a dialog to select the UML Metclasses to import in the model:

* An ElementImport referencing the metaclass will be created for each imported Metaclass +
* These selected metaclasses will be represented in the Diagram +
If the user select a Metaclass already imported in the container (Package or Profile), the corresponding ElementImport won't be created a second time, but the Metaclass will be represented if it was previously not represented.

==== Can create
Can be imported only once, a second import of the same class will do nothing.

==== OnSet
Nothing special.

==== On Deletion
Semantic Deletion is forbidden, because the Metaclasses are not created but are imported. So to remove an imported Metaclass from your model, you should destroy the corresponding ElementImport from the Explorer view.

==== On Semantic DnD
Element not visible in explorer, only used via the import Metaclass tool.

==== On Direct Edit
Nothing special.

==== Label
Name of the imported UML element prefixed with &laquo;Metaclass&raquo;.
