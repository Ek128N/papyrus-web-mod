** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Constraint_

== CPD06 Comment Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of a comment deletes both the comment node and the link connected to it.

.Recipe
* Create/open a CPD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Component_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and the _Component_
* Delete the _Comment_
** [ ] The _Comment_ and the link are deleted

== CPD07 Link Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of comment/constraint links works as expected and doesn't delete any semantic object.

.Recipe
* Create/open a CPD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Constraint_ using the tool in the palette
* Create two _Component_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and both _Component_ (2 links) and between the _Constraint_ and both _Component_ (2 links)
* Delete the links one by one
** [ ] Only the graphical links are deleted, no semantic element is deleted when a link is deleted

== CPD08 Port semantic DnD on Component
.Purpose
Check that a port can be semantically drag and dropped on its parent component.

.Recipe
* Create/open a CPD diagram
* Create a _Component_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Port_ on the component using the tool in the palette
* Graphically delete the _Port_
* Drag the port from the Model Explorer and drop it on the _Component_
** [ ] The _Port_ is created on the _Component_

== CPD09 Port semantic DnD on typed Property
.Purpose
Check that a port can be semantically drag and dropped in its semantic container as well as on properties typed by its semantic container.

.Recipe
* Create/open a CPD diagram
* Create two _Components_ "C1" and "C2" using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Property_ in "C1" and configure its type with "C2" via the properties view
* Create a _Port_ on the typed _Property_
** [ ] The _Port_ is created graphically on the _Property_ and semantically in the _Component_ "C2"
* Delete the _Port_ from the diagram
* Drag the _Port_ from the Model Explorer and drop it on the typed _Property_
** [ ] The _Port_ node is created on the typed _Property_ one
* Delete the _Port_ from the diagram
* Drag the _Port_ from the Model Explorer and drop it on _Component_ "C2"
** [ ] The _Port_ node is created on the _Component_ "C2" one

== CPD10 Property semantic DnD on typed Property
.Purpose
Check that a property can be semantically drag and dropped in its semantic container as well as on properties typed by its semantic container.

.Recipe
* Create/open a CPD diagram
* Create two _Components_ "C1" and "C2" using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Property_ in "C1" and configure its type with "C2" via the properties view
* Create a _Property_ on the typed _Property_
** [ ] The _Property_ is created graphically in the typed _Property_ and semantically in the _Component_ "C2"
* Delete the _Property_ from the diagram
* Drag the _Property_ from the Model Explorer and drop it on the typed _Property_
** [ ] The _Property_ node is created in the typed _Property_ one
* Delete the _Property_ from the diagram
* Drag the _Property_ from the Model Explorer and drop it on _Component_ "C2"
** [ ] The _Port_ node is created on the _Component_ "C2" one

== CPD11 Property graphical DnD
.Purpose
Check that a property can be graphically drag and dropped in components and typed properties.

.Recipe
* Create/open a CPD diagram
* Create three _Components_ "C1", "C2", and "C3" using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Property_ "P1" in "C1" using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Property_ "P2" in "C2" and configure its type with "C3" using the properties view
* Graphically drag "P1" in "P2"
** [ ] The _Property_ node "P1" is moved inside the node "P2". The semantic _Property_ "P1" is added in "C3" in the Model Explorer
* Graphically drag "P1" in "C1"
** [ ] The _Property_ node "P1" is moved inside the node "C1". The semantic _Property_ "P1" is added in "C1" in the Model Explorer, and its not in "C3" anymore

== CPD12 Semantic DnD to type a Property
.Purpose
Check that a property can be typed by dropping a type element on it.

.Recipe
* Create/open a CPD diagram
* Create two _Components_ "C1" and "C2" using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Property_ in "C1" using the tool in the palette
* Drag "C2" from the Model Explorer on the _Property_
** [ ] The _Property_ is now typed with "C2" (visible in the properties view)

== CPD13 Connector semantic DnD
.Purpose
Check that a connector edge can be dropped from the Model Explorer to the diagram.

.Recipe
* Create/open a CPD diagram
* Create a _Component_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Property_ in the _Component_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Port_ on the _Component_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Connector_ between the _Property_ and the _Port_
** [ ] The _Connector_ edge is created and visible on the diagram
* Graphically delete the _Property_ and the _Port_
** [ ] The _Connector_ edge is not visible on the diagram
* Drag the semantic _Connector_ from the Model Explorer to the diagram
** [ ] The _Property_ and the _Port_ nodes are created and the _Connector_ edge is visible on the diagram
