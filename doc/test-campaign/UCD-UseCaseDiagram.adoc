:toc:

== UCD01 Automated Tests

.Purpose
Run the automated tests and check they all pass.

.Recipe
* [ ] Run the diagram creation tests
* [ ] Run Node and Edge creation tests
* [ ] Run Node and Edge deletion tests
* [ ] Run the Semantic DnD tests
* [ ] Run the Graphical DnD tests
* [ ] Run the source and target reconnect tests
* [ ] Run the direct edit tests

== UCD02 Documentation
.Purpose
Check that the documentation for the diagram is available.

.Recipe
* [ ] Open the documentation and check that the UseCase Diagram section is present

== UCD03 Conditional Styles
.Purpose 
Check that the conditional styles are applied when they should.

.Recipe
* Create a _Class_ using the palette and set its _is abstract_ attribute to true.
** [ ] The label of the _Class_ is displayed in italic

== UCD04 Comment Link
.Purpose
Check that the creation and reconnection of comment links works as expected.

.Recipe
* Create/open an UCD diagram
* Create two _Class_ elements
* Create a _Comment_ and a link from the _Comment_ to the first _Class_
** [ ] The link is visible
* Reconnect the target of the link to the second _Class_
** [ ] The link is connected to the second _Class_
* Create a _Constraint_ element
* Try to reconnect the source of the link to the _Constraint_
** [ ] The link cannot be reconnected to the _Constraint_
* Create another _Comment_ element
* Reconnect the source of the link to the new _Comment_
** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Comment_

== UCD05 Constraint Link
.Purpose
Check that the creation and reconnection of constraint links works as expected.

.Recipe
* Create/open an UCD diagram
* Create two _Class_ elements
* Create a _Constraint_ and a link from the _Constraint_ to the first _Class_
** [ ] The link is visible
* Reconnect the target of the link to the second _Class_
** [ ] The link is connected to the second _Class_
* Create a _Comment_ element
* Try to reconnect the source of the link to the _Comment_
** [ ] The link cannot be reconnected to the _Comment_
* Create another _Constraint_ element
* Reconnect the source of the link to the new _Constraint_
** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Constraint_

== UCD06 Comment Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of a comment deletes both the comment node and the link connected to it.

.Recipe
* Create/open an UCD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Class__ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and the _Class_
* Delete the _Comment_
** [ ] The _Comment_ and the link are deleted

== UCD07 Link Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of comment/constraint links works as expected and doesn't delete any semantic object.

.Recipe
* Create/open an UCD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Constraint_ using the tool in the palette
* Create two _Classes_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and both _Classes_ (2 links) and between the _Constraint_ and both _Classes_ (2 links)
* Delete the links one by one
** [ ] Only the graphical links are deleted, no semantic element is deleted when a link is deleted

== UCD08 Keep Ratio
.Purpose
Check that the Actor node keeps its ratio when resized.

.Recipe
* Create/open an UCD diagram
* Create an _Actor_ using the tool in the palette
* Resize the _Actor_
** [ ] The _Actor_ keeps its width/height ratio
