= Communication Diagram Tests
:toc:

== COD01 Automated Tests

.Purpose
Run the automated tests and check they all pass.

.Recipe
* [ ] Run the diagram creation tests
* [ ] Run Node and Edge creation tests
* [ ] Run Node and Edge deletion tests
* [ ] Run the Semantic DnD tests
* [ ] Run the source and target reconnect tests
* [ ] Run the direct edit tests

== COD02 Documentation
.Purpose
Check that the documentation for the diagram is available.

.Recipe
* [ ] Open the documentation and check that the Communication Diagram section is present

== COD04 Comment Link
.Purpose
Check that the creation and reconnection of comment links works as expected.

.Recipe
* Create/open an COD diagram
* Create two _Lifeline_ elements
* Create a _Comment_ and a link from the _Comment_ to the first _Lifeline_
** [ ] The link is visible
* Reconnect the target of the link to the second _Lifeline_
** [ ] The link is connected to the second _Lifeline_
* Create a _Constraint_ element
* Try to reconnect the source of the link to the _Constraint_
** [ ] The link cannot be reconnected to the _Constraint_
* Create another _Comment_ element
* Reconnect the source of the link to the new _Comment_
** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Comment_

== COD05 Constraint Link
.Purpose
Check that the creation and reconnection of constraint links works as expected.

.Recipe
* Create/open an COD diagram
* Create two _Lifeline_ elements
* Create a _Constraint_ and a link from the _Constraint_ to the first _Lifeline_
** [ ] The link is visible
* Reconnect the target of the link to the second _Lifeline_
** [ ] The link is connected to the second _Lifeline_
* Create a _Comment_ element
* Try to reconnect the source of the link to the _Comment_
** [ ] The link cannot be reconnected to the _Comment_
* Create another _Constraint_ element
* Reconnect the source of the link to the new _Constraint_
** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Constraint_

== COD06 Comment Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of a comment deletes both the comment node and the link connected to it.

.Recipe
* Create/open an COD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Lifeline_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and the _Lifeline_
* Delete the _Comment_
** [ ] The _Comment_ and the link are deleted

== COD07 Link Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of comment/constraint links works as expected and doesn't delete any semantic object.

.Recipe
* Create/open an COD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Constraint_ using the tool in the palette
* Create two _Lifeline_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and both _Lifeline_ (2 links) and between the _Constraint_ and both _Lifeline_ (2 links)
* Delete the links one by one
** [ ] Only the graphical links are deleted, no semantic element is deleted when a link is deleted
