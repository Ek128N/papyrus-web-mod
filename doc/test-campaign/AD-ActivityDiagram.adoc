* [ ] Run the direct edit tests

== AD02 Documentation
.Purpose
Check that the documentation for the diagram is available.

* [ ] Open the documentation and check that the Activity Diagram section is present

== AD03 Conditional Styles
.Purpose 
Check that the conditional styles are applied when they should.

.Recipe
* Create/open a AD diagram
* Set the _is abstract_ attribute of the root _Activity_ to true
** [ ] The label of the root _Activity_ is displayed in italic

== AD04 Comment Link
.Purpose
Check that the creation and reconnection of comment links works as expected.

.Recipe
* Create/open an AD diagram
* Create two _Activity_ elements
* Create a _Comment_ and a link from the _Comment_ to the first _Activity_
** [ ] The link is visible
* Reconnect the target of the link to the second _Activity_
** [ ] The link is connected to the second _Activity_
* Create a _Constraint_ element
* Try to reconnect the source of the link to the _Constraint_
** [ ] The link cannot be reconnected to the _Constraint_
* Create another _Comment_ element
* Reconnect the source of the link to the new _Comment_
** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Comment_

== AD05 Constraint Link
.Purpose
Check that the creation and reconnection of constraint links works as expected.

.Recipe
* Create/open an AD diagram
* Create two _Activity_ elements
* Create a _Constraint_ and a link from the _Constraint_ to the first _Activity_
** [ ] The link is visible
* Reconnect the target of the link to the second _Activity_
** [ ] The link is connected to the second _Activity_
* Create a _Comment_ element
* Try to reconnect the source of the link to the _Comment_
** [ ] The link cannot be reconnected to the _Comment_
* Create another _Constraint_ element
* Reconnect the source of the link to the new _Constraint_
** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Constraint_

== AD06 Comment Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of a comment deletes both the comment node and the link connected to it.

.Recipe
* Create/open an AD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Activity_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and the _Activity_
* Delete the _Comment_
** [ ] The _Comment_ and the link are deleted

== AD07 Link Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of comment/constraint links works as expected and doesn't delete any semantic object.

.Recipe
* Create/open an AD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Constraint_ using the tool in the palette
* Create two _Activity_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and both _Activity_ (2 links) and between the _Constraint_ and both _Activity_ (2 links)
* Delete the links one by one
** [ ] Only the graphical links are deleted, no semantic element is deleted when a link is deleted

== AD08 Rotative Border Nodes
.Purpose
Check that the image inside the border nodes representing pins rotate around their container.

.Recipe
* Create/open a AD diagram
* Create a _TestIdentityAction_ using the tool in the palette
* Move the _InputPin_ and _OutputPin_ around the _TestIdentityAction_
** [ ] The border node image direction changes according to its position around its container

== AD09 Precondition on Border Node Creation
.Purpose
Check that border node creation aren't possible if their containment feature is already full.

.Recipe
* Create/open a AD diagram
* Create an _AddStructuralFeatureValueAction_ using the tool in the palette
* Semantically delete the _OutputPin_ of the _AddStructuralFeatureValueAction_ using the palette
* Create an _OutputPin_ on the _AddStructuralFeatureValueAction_ using the palette
** [ ] The _OutputPin_ is created and its border node is visible
* Open the palette on _AddStructuralFeatureValueAction_
** [ ] The tool "New Output Pin" is not available

== AD10 DecisionNode Note
.Purpose
Check that the DecisionNode note is visible if decision input is set.

.Recipe
* Create/open a AD diagram
* Create a _DecisionNode_ using the tool in the palette
* Set the _decision input_ value of the _DecisionNode_ with the root _Activity_
** [ ] A note is displayed next to the _DecisionNode_ with the label "«decisionInput» Activity1". The note is connected to the _DecisionNode_ with a dotted edge.

== AD11 DecisionNode Note in ActivityPartition
.Purpose
Check that the DecisionNode note is visible if decision input is set and that the note is in the ActivityPartition containing the DecisionNode.

.Recipe
* Create/open a AD diagram
* Create an _ActivityPartition_ on the diagram
* Create a _DecisionNode_ in the _ActivityPartition_
* Set the _decision input_ value of the _DecisionNode_ with the root _Activity_
** [ ] A note is displayed inside the _ActivityPartition_, next to the _DecisionNode_ with the label "«decisionInput» Activity1". The note is connected to the _DecisionNode_ with a dotted edge.

== AD12 Graphical DnD of DecisionNode Note
.Purpose
Check that it is not possible to graphically drag and drop the note associated to a DecisionNode.

.Recipe
* Create/open a AD diagram
* Create an _ActivityPartition_ on the diagram
* Create a _DecisionNode_ in the _ActivityPartition_
* Set the _decision input_ value of the _DecisionNode_ with the root _Activity_
* Graphically DnD the note in the root _Activity_
** [ ] The note is not moved in the root _Activity_


== AD13 Semantic DnD of a Control Flow
* Create/open a AD diagram
* Create an _ActivityParameterNode_ on the root _Activity_ and set its _is control type_ attribute to true
* Create an _ExpansionRegion_ on the root _Activity_
* Create an _ExpansionNode_ on the _ExpansionRegion_ and set its _is control type_ attribute to true
* Create a _ControlFlow_ from the _ActivityParameterNode_ to the _ExpansionNode_
** [ ] The _ControlFlow_ edge is created between the elements
* Graphically delete the _ActivityParameterNode_ and the _ExpansionNode_
* Semantically drop the _ControlFlow_ edge on the diagram
** [ ] The _ActivityParameterNode_ and the _ExpansionNode_ are graphically created and the edge is visible
