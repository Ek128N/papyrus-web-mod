.Recipe
* Create/open an PRD diagram
* Create two _Class_ elements

* Reconnect the target of the link to the second _Class_
** [ ] The link is connected to the second _Class_

* Try to reconnect the source of the link to the _Constraint_
** [ ] The link cannot be reconnected to the _Constraint_
* Create another _Comment_ element
* Reconnect the source of the link to the new _Comment_
** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Comment_

== PRD05 Constraint Link
.Purpose
Check that the creation and reconnection of constraint links works as expected.

.Recipe
* Create/open an PRD diagram
* Create two _Class_ elements
* Create a _Constraint_ and a link from the _Constraint_ to the first _Class_
** [ ] The link is visible
* Reconnect the target of the link to the second _Class_
** [ ] The link is connected to the second _Class_
* Create a _Comment_ element
* Try to reconnect the source of the link to the _Comment_
** [ ] The link cannot be reconnected to the _Comment_
* Create another _Constraint_ element
* Reconnect the source of the link to the new _Constraint_
** [ ] The link is reconnected to the _Constraint_

== PRD06 Comment Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of a comment deletes both the comment node and the link connected to it.

.Recipe
* Create/open an PRD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Class__ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and the _Class_
* Delete the _Comment_
** [ ] The _Comment_ and the link are deleted

== PRD07 Link Deletion
.Purpose
Check that the deletion of comment/constraint links works as expected and doesn't delete any semantic object.

.Recipe
* Create/open an PRD diagram
* Create a _Comment_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Constraint_ using the tool in the palette
* Create two _Classes_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a link between the _Comment_ and both _Classes_ (2 links) and between the _Constraint_ and both _Classes_ (2 links)
* Delete the links one by one
** [ ] Only the graphical links are deleted, no semantic element is deleted when a link is deleted

== PRD08 Graphical DnD of a Comment
.Purpose
Check that a Comment can be graphically dragged and dropped.

.Recipe
* Create/open a PRD diagram
* Create two _Packages_ using the tool in the palette
* Create a _Comment_ in the first package
* Graphically drag and drop the _Comment_ between the _Packages_
** [ ] The _Comment_ is graphically moved and its semantic container is updated

== PRD09 Create Metaclass
.Purpose
Check that the "import metaclass" tool works as expected.

.Recipe
* Create/open a PRD diagram
* Select the "Import Metaclass" tool in the palette
** [ ] A dialog is displayed with the list of metaclasses available
* Select the _Activity_ metaclass and move it in the right panel of the dialog, then click the Apply button
** [ ] The metaclass is added on the diagram and an _ElementImport_ is created under the semantic root of the diagram, with its _imported element_ set to _Activity_
** [ ] The metaclass is created where the user clicked to open the palette
* Create a _Profile_ on the diagram
* Create another _Activity_ metaclass inside the created _Profile_
** [ ] The metaclass is added in the _Profile_ and an _ElementImport_ is created under the semantic _Profile_, with its _imported element_ set to _Activity_
** [ ] The metaclass is created where the user clicked to open the palette

== PRD10 Edge targeting Metaclasses
.Purpose
Check that edges targeting Metaclasses can be created.

.Recipe
* Create/open a PRD diagram
* Create an _Activity_ metaclass on the diagram
* Create a _Stereotype_ on the diagram
* Create an _Extension_ edge from the _Stereotype_ to the metaclass
** [ ] The edge is created
* Create a _Generalization_ edge from the _Stereotype_ to the metaclass
** [ ] The edge is created

== PRD11 Metaclass graphical deletion
.Purpose
Check that Metaclasses can be graphically deleted.

.Recipe
* Create/open a PRD diagram
* Create an _Activity_ metaclass on the diagram
* Graphically delete the metaclass
** [ ] The node is deleted from the diagram. The model explorer still contains an _ElementImport_ with its _imported element_ set to _Activity_
* Re-create an _Activity_ metaclass on the diagram
** [ ] The metaclass node is created, but no new _ElementImport_ is created in the model explorer
* Re-create an _Activity_ metaclass on the diagram
** [ ] Nothing happens. The node previously visible is still visible, and no new _ElementImport_ has been created

== PRD12 Metaclass semantic deletion
.Purpose
Check that Metaclasses can be semantically deleted.

.Recipe
* Create/open a PRD diagram
* Create an _Activity_ metaclass on the diagram
* Open the palette of the created metaclass
** [ ] The palette doesn't contain the semantic deletion tool
* Delete the corresponding _ElementImport_ in the model explorer
** [ ] The metaclass node is deleted from the diagram, the model explorer doesn't contain the _ElementImport_ anymore

== PRD13 Graphical DnD of a Metaclass
* Create/open a PRD diagram
* Create an _Activity_ metaclass on the diagram
* Create a _Profile_ on the diagram
* Graphically drag & drop the metaclass in the _Profile_
** [ ] The node is moved in the _Profile_ node and the semantic _ElementImport_ is moved in the semantic _Profile_
* Graphically drag & drop the metaclass from the _Profile_ to the diagram
** [ ] The node is moved on the diagram and the semantic _ElementImport_ is moved in the root _Profile_ of the diagram
* Create an _Activity_ metaclass in the _Profile_
** [ ] The _Profile_ contains an _Activity_ metaclass node. The diagram also contains an _Activity_ metaclass node.
* Graphically drag & drop the _Action_ metaclass from the diagram to the _Profile_
** [ ] An error message is displayed and the node is not moved
