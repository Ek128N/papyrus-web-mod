== Profile01 - Publish profiles

.Purpose
Check that the profiles can be imported published and downloaded

. download the profile
** [ ] the difference with previous download is the `EAnnotation` containing an `EPackage`
. Go to the main web page and wait 7s to be sure that data are released on the server
. Open the _profiles_ project again
** [ ] The annotation is still displayed in the Explorer tree under the profile.


== Profile02 - Use a dynamic profile

.Purpose
Check that the UML model can use a dynamic profile

.Recipe
. create an _UML_ project using the template
. contextual menu on Package1/Apply profile
. select the published profile
** [ ] the profile application is visible in the tree
. contextual menu on Package1/Apply profile
. select the same published profile
** [ ] no error is diplayed
. contextual menu on Class1/Apply stereotype
. select the available Stereotype

<details xmi:type="ecore:EStringToStringMapEntry" xmi:id="_3AlglM9BEe6clZMqIDuyGw" key="Version" value="1.2.3"/>

== Profile04 - Update a dynamic profile (UML model check)

Check that the UML model using a profile keeps the reference to this profile when the profile is published in a new version.

.Recipe
. Go to the main web page and wait 7s to be sure that data are released on the server
. Open the project containing _UML sample self contained.uml_
