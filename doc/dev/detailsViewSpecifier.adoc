=== Pages management in Details panel

This section focus upon the API that can be used to manage pages inside the Details panel of Papyrus web.

==== Main API

The entry point to be able to manage pages in the Details panel is:

[source, java]
--
org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.forms.api.IFormPostProcessor
--

The way to follow is to create a Spring service that implements this API and override the following method:

[source, java]
--
Form postProcess(Form form, VariableManager variableManager)
--

This method will receive an immutable _Form_ instance that represents the Details panel and variables available at this point. 
Therefore, it is possible to filter/sort/organize pages retrieved from that original _Form_ and return the desired presentation as a *new* _Form_ instance.

==== Papyrus implementation

The Papyrus implementation of this API can be found in the following class:

[source, java]
--
org.eclipse.papyrus.web.application.properties.services.PapyrusDetailsPostProcessor
--

This implementation sorts pages as it was designed in papyrus desktop: starts with the `UML` tab followed by tabs `Comments` and `Profile` and ends with `Advanced` one.

=== Predefined language list of the language expression widget

OpaqueExpressions, OpaqueActions, OpaqueBehaviors and FunctionBehaviors UML elements have a special property `language` that can be edited in the UML tab of the Details panel with a dedicated widget. This widget allows to choose a language among a predefined list. At the moment, this list of language names is hardcoded in the backend code. This list is located in:

```
org.eclipse.papyrus.web.custom.widgets.languageexpression.LanguageExpressionComponent.getPredefinedLanguages()
```

Here its definition:

[source, java]
-----
  private List<String> getPredefinedLanguages() {
      return List.of("C", "C++", "JAVA", "Natural Language", "OCL");
  }
-----

=== Implement new custom widget

[TIP]
Additional information on how to contribute a new widget custom menus in the _Explorer_ view in the https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/doc/how-to/contribute-custom-widget.adoc[Sirius Web documentation].
