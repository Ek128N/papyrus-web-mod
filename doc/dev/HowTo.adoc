=== How overidde a Sirius Web service

In some cases you will need to override service to provided by Sirius Web.
To do so, create a custom implementation of the service and use the annotation `org.eclipse.papyrus.web.sirius.contributions.ServiceOverride`.
You need to specify the overridden service in the annotation.
This information is only here to keep tracks.
It is important when bumping _sirius component_ version in order to keeps tracks of the changes applied to the overridden services.
