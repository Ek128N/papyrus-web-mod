=== GraphQL test framework
Papyrus Web provides a _test framework_ to ease the development of test suites for your diagrams. The framework is a generic testing infrastructure defined at the boundaries of Papyrus Web's _backend_: it simulates the invocation of tools (Node Creation, Edge Creation, etc) via the GraphQL API, and checks the data exposed to the frontend. This approach allows to finely check graphical and semantic data, but cannot perform graphical-level tests through the user interface (this can be done with end-to-end integration tests like Cypress).

The Papyrus Web test framework is defined in the `papyrus-web-application` module (in the `src/tests` directory), in the packages prefixed with _tool_:

- *org.eclipse.papyrus.web.application.tools.test*: the abstract test classes that can be extended by the specifier to test specific tools. These classes provide a common ground to implement tests, and are designed to allow parameterization of concrete implementations.
- *org.eclipse.papyrus.web.application.tools.checker*: the generic checkers used by the tests to verify the diagram and the semantic model. These checkers operate at the semantic or graphical level, and can be grouped in a `CombinedChecker`.
-  *org.eclipse.papyrus.web.application.tools.utils*: a set of utility classes that provide common behavior and data for the implementation of test cases. For example, this package contains a default implementation of the `MappingTypes` class, that allows to compute the mapping type associated to a given UML type.

Implementations of the test framework for a specific diagram should follow the same naming/packaging conventions. For example, the Use Case Diagram implementation is defined in the following packages:

- *org.eclipse.papyrus.web.application.tools.usecase*: the concrete implementation of the abstract test classes provided by the framework. These classes allow to test node creation, edge creation, etc in the context of the Use Case Diagram.
- *org.eclipse.papyrus.web.application.tools.usecase.utils*: utility classes specific to the Use Case Diagram. For example, the `UCDMappingTypes` extends `MappingType` to support Use Case specific mappings.

=== Cypress tests

Sometimes Cypress tests encounter problems during the CI build when a branch is pushed for PR for instance.
It may occur that these tests passed locally and so it is difficult to find what is the cause of this failure.
In such situation, we need to reproduce the same running environment to be able to fix issues.
Process to launch locally Cypress tests as CI does is described with following steps:

==== Step 1 Build the fat jar

From the root folder of the frontend (`papyrus-web/frontend`) run the following commands:

 1. `npm ci`
 2. `npm run build`

From the root folder of the project (`papyrus`) run the following commands:

 1. `mkdir -p backend/papyrus-web-frontend/src/main/resources/static`
 2. `cp -R frontend/papyrus-web/dist/* backend/papyrus-web-frontend/src/main/resources/static`
 3. `mvn -U -B clean verify -f backend/pom.xml` (others commands allows to run more tests or to ignore the tests). See **Maven tests** chapters for more details

==== Step 2 Prepare and run the Docker image

For demonstration purpose, let say that the current version of Papyrus-web is `2023.12.0`, in the project root folder run the following commands:

 1. `sed -e "s|VERSION|2023.12.0|" backend/papyrus-web-application/Dockerfile.template > backend/papyrus-web-application/Dockerfile`
 2. `docker build -t papyrusweb backend/papyrus-web-application`
 3. `docker-compose -f backend/papyrus-web-application/docker-compose.yml up -d`

The current version should be adapted in the first command.

==== Step 3 Run the integration Cypress tests

From the integration tests folder (`papyrus-web/integration-tests`) run the final command to launch Cypress:

 1. `npm start` 

Cypress is running tests on `8080` port to reach papyrus-web server.


=== Maven tests
The previous chapters indicate how to build Papyrus-Web given you a maven command. Here we propose you 2 others versions of this command, to execute more tests or to ignore them
From the root folder of the project (`papyrus`) run the following commands:
 - `mvn -U -B clean verify -f backend/pom.xml` : launch some quick tests (this is the command indicated previously)
 - `mvn -U -B clean verify -DskipTests -f backend/pom.xml` : allow to skip all the tests execution
 - `mvn -U -B clean verify -DallTests -f backend/pom.xml` : launch all tests (this build takes around 7 hours)
