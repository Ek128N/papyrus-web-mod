== Home page

The home page is the starting point of a modeling project. It is where user can initiate a new project or manage an existing one.

Creating a new project in the platform can be done in the following ways:

* Create a blank UML project (template UML empty)
* Create a project from existing templates
* Upload a previously exported project

As far as existing projects are concerned, the following actions are available:

* Open an existing project +
To open an existing project, the user has to locate the project in the Project list and click on its name.
* Delete a project +
You can delete a Project from the Projects Browser:

. In the Project list, go over the Project to get the Delete button,
. Click on the Delete button.

* Rename a project +
You can update the Project name from the Projects Browser:

. In the Project list, go over the Project to get the Rename button,
. Click on the Rename button,
. Update the name in the editable field,
. Click on Rename.

Once the project (new or existing) is chosen, the workbench page is presented.

== Workbench

The Workbench page is the main page where Projects are edited.
It is basically composed of one main central area and two side panels. +
The <<project-explorer-panel,`left panel`>> is mainly used to see the structure of the Project as a tree of all its parts.
The <<diagram-panel,`central area`>> is the place where diagrams live and the <<right-side-panel,`right panel`>> can display the Properties of the current project explorer selection.

[[project-explorer-panel]]
=== Project Explorer panel

The Explorer panel displays all elements contained by the _Project_. Root nodes are the _Resources_ stored in the project where all elements underneath live. The root element for _UML_ resources is generally a _Model_ or a _Profile_.

WARNING: Note that the name of the resource should always end with `.uml`.

==== _Explorer toolbar_

The _Explorer toolbar_ contains global _Project_ actions:

* _Add model_ +
  Create a new model
* _Upload model_ +
  Add a previously downloaded UML _Model_ into the _Project_. Accepted UML _Model_ files should have the `.uml` extension
* _Filters_ +
  The list of filters that can applied to the explorer content (they depend on the current explorer)
* _Explorers_ +
  The list of explorers available to present the given project depending of its nature.
  As far as UML projects are concerned, a dedicated explorer has been introduced.
  If no specific explorers are defined for the current project, the explorer selector icon is hidden and the default explorer is used.
* Synchronization with _Representation_ editor +
  When Synchronization with _Representation_ is *enabled*, selecting a graphical element in the diagram will *_Reveal_* and *_Select_* the semantic element corresponding in the _Explorer_ tree. +
  When Synchronization with _Representation_ is *disabled*, selecting a graphical element in the diagram will *_Select_* the semantic element corresponding in the _Explorer_ tree only if it has already been revealed.

==== _Explorer Tree (general)_

To create a _New Representation Diagram_, use the contextual menu on any semantic element and choose the action _New Representation_, choose the type of diagram in the dialog.

The _Explorer_ tree contains semantic elements of the _Model_ and diagrams at the same level.
Diagram elements can be easily recognized by the diagram icon image:diagram.svg[diagram icon,16] whereas semantic elements have specific icons depending on their nature.

From the _Explorer_ view, it is possible to create new semantic elements. To do so, use the contextual menu on any semantic element and choose _New Object_. In the dialog, select the new element to create among all semantic elements listed in the dropdown (names are prefixed by the containment feature).

Regarding the representation creation, it is worth noting that _Representations_ depend on the selected semantic element (the one used to open the contextual menu). Here are available representations and their creation contexts:

|===
| Representation | Context

| _Activity Diagram_
| _Package_, _BehavioredClassifier_

| _Class Diagram_
| _Package_

| _Communication Diagram_
| _Package_, _BehavioredClassifier_

| _Component Diagram_
| _Package_

| _Composite Structure Diagram_
| _Package_

| _Deployment Diagram_
| _Package_

| _Package_
| _Package_

| _Portal_
| Any semantic element in the project

| _Profile Diagram_
| _Profile or Package (in a `.profile.uml` model)_

| _State Machine Diagram_
| _State Machine_

| _Use Case Diagram_
| _Package_

|===

As we can see in the table above, the _State Machine Diagram_ can only be created on a _State Machine_ semantic element.

Deletion of semantic elements (and representation diagrams) is possible through the contextual menu of tree nodes.

==== UML explorer

As far as UML projects are concerned, there is a dedicated explorer to present project content with few specific features that improve the user experience.

image::uml-explorer.png[Labels Overview,400, align="center"]

===== Elements to Hide

The following elements should not be displayed:

* Stereotype application
* EAnnotation

===== Label Customization

Stereotypes applied to UML elements must be displayed using quotes (« »).

===== Label Style Customization

====== Read only

Read-only elements should be displayed in gray. +
The  read-only elements are:

* Standard libraries
* Profiles (static and dynamic)
* `PackageImport` elements
* `ElementImport` elements

====== Abstract

All elements with a property named "abstract" of type boolean, containing the value true, must be displayed in italics.

====== Static

All elements with a property named "static" of type boolean, containing the value true, must be underlined.

====== Stereotype

The name of stereotypes applied to an element should be displayed in green.

===== Tree Structure Modification

`PackageImport` and `ElementImport` elements must add, in addition to existing children, the imported element to allow its containment tree to be expanded.

==== Publish profile

Publish a profile in a dedicated database so it can be used by other projects.
If the profile is already published, a new version is pushed to the database.

WARNING: Be aware that if a project already uses this profile it will not be notified that a new version is available until the project is unloaded which means that nobody has this project opened during 7 seconds.


==== Apply profile

To apply a profile use the contextual menu from the root _Model_ element.
Select the profile to apply to the list of candidates.
The available profiles are:

* The static profiles registered in the platform
* The dynamic profiles stored in other projects of your _Papyrus Web_ server.

==== Apply stereotype

To apply a stereotype:

* Make sure that the correct profile is applied on your _Model_
* Use the contextual menu _Apply Stereotype_ on an element
* Select the _Stereotype_ to apply

The properties of this stereotype are now displayed in there own tab in the _Detail_ panel.

=== Validation panel

The _Validation_ panel shares the left area of the workbench page with the _Explorer_.
The validation view shows diagnostics of the whole project. Diagnostics are sorted by kind (for example ERROR, WARNING or INFO) and can be either hidden or displayed thanks to an accordeon widget.

[[diagram-panel]]
=== Diagram panel

==== Generalities

The diagram panel shows _Representation Diagrams_ created in the project. Several _Representations_ can be opened and they appear in separate tabs.
Diagrams represent graphically a part of your semantic model. Each representation defines its own set of rules regarding its content. +
Graphical elements can be selected by clicking on elements. The innermost clicked element is selected.
A red border (with eight square handles) appears around the element when it is selected. +
Once a graphical element is selected by clicking on it, it will reveal a set of available tools grouped in a horizontal palette.

The Palette displays all the tools available according to the current selection. It has the following subgroups from left to right:

* Children element creation group +
All children's creation actions are grouped in a dropdown list depending on the selected element's nature.
* Generic tools (Edit, Delete from the diagram, Delete from the model, Hide, Fade, Pin)
As far as Edit is concerned, it is worth noting that names (or more generally texts) can be edited in the following ways:
 ** Edit action of the Palette
 ** Press F2
 ** Type directly the new name
+
WARNING: As far as _Edge_ elements are concerned, start and end labels cannot be edited on the diagram. The above ways will edit the edge label itself (the centered label of the edge), and double-clicking on them won't allow their edition.
* Collapse / Expand tools +
Those actions are only available for containers or compartments (e.g _Package_ or _Operations Compartment_ of a _Class_)

The Diagram panel has global actions grouped in a horizontal toolbar underneath the diagram tabs.

image::diagramPalette.png[Labels Overview,400, align="center"]

This toolbar contains the following actions:

* Display full screen
* Fit screen action
* Zoom group
* Share the diagram link
* Export diagram as SVG
* Arrange all elements
* Display Grid
* Reveal hidden elements of action
* Reveal faded elements of action
* Unpin all elements

===== Label
Keywords on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label. If the semantic element is stereotyped, the stereotype is displayed on a second separate line. Finally, the label will be displayed on the third line. The label can be the simple name of the element, or more complex in some specific cases detailed in the corresponding diagram section.
Label of UML elements with the _isAbstract_ feature set to true is displayed in italic.
Label of UML elements with the _isStatic_ feature set to true is displayed underlined.
For element displayed in compartment node with list layout, the label composed of keyword, stereotype and name is diplayed on one line.

image::labelsDisplayed.png[Labels Overview,400, align="center"]

===== Edge Creation
Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge's source and target types. If the creation of an Edge is not authorized, the target node appears faded. When user try to create an edge, he clicks first on the source element to display arrow. Then he clicks on one of these arrows and stay click until the target. User can see the feedback of the edge and the target node is highlighted. It is not possible for now to create an Edge between two Edges or between an Edge and a Node. 

image::edgeCreation.png[Labels Overview,400, align="center"]

===== Semantic Drag&Drop
Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram. This drag and drop doesn't perform any semantic modification, except in specific case detailed in the corresponding diagram section. In addition, some diagrams allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram.  

Dragging and dropping an element represented as an Edge on the diagram will create the source/target elements of the Edge if they aren't already represented. Note that Edges can be dropped anywhere on the diagram, but they will only appear in their semantic container. 

===== Graphical Drag&Drop
User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node. Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded. When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted.

image::graphicalDragAndDrop.png[Labels Overview,400, align="center"]

===== Reconnection
Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element.

===== Semantic Deletion
A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the _Delete from model_ tool in the palette or via the Model Explorer. This behavior can be disabled by checking the "Disable this confirmation dialog" checkbox in the dialog.

image::deletion-dialog.png[Semantic Deletion Dialog,300, align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
This preference is stored in the browser's local storage. You can reset it by deleting the Papyrus Web data in your browser's cache.
====

==== Activity Diagram

Activity diagrams help to focus on workflows. They are therefore particularly suitable for modeling control flows and data flows. They allow to graphically represent the behavior of a method or the course of a use case. 

image::diagActivity.png[Activity Diagram Overview,900, align="center"]

===== Specific Features on Creation
- When creating an _ActivityPartition_ in an _Activity_, the partition is added in the _Activity#partition_ feature of the _Activity_. This feature is a subset of the _Activity#OwnedGroup_ containment feature.
- An _AcceptEventAction_ is represented with an hourglass when it has exactly one _Trigger_ that references a _TimeEvent_ in its _Trigger#event_ feature.

===== Specific Features on _Pin_
- The _Pin_ creation tool is deactivated if several containment features are possible to own the _Pin_.
- On an UML element, if the feature multiplicity is _[0..1]_ or _[1..1]_ or _[1..*]_, a _Pin_ is created at the same time as the element creation. 
- The _Pin_ name is set with the name of the feature, if the feature is _[0..1]_ or _[1..1]_.

===== Specific Features on Container
Some containers do not contain semantically their graphical nodes. This is the case for _ActivityPartition_ and _InterruptibleActivityRegion_.
_ActivityNodes_ contained in those containers are owned by the first parent _Activity_.

image::graphicalContainerNotSemanticContainer.png[Activity Node Graphical Container,400, align="center"]

===== Specific Features on _DecisionNode_
A note attached to the _DecisionNode_ is displayed when the _DecisionNode#decisionInput_ feature is set.
This note only appears if the _DecisionNode_ node is displayed.

image::decisionNode.png[Decision Node,400, align="center"]

===== Specific Features on Direct Edit
- The direct edit tool doesn't perform any modification on the root _Activity_ nor _Constraint_/_Comment_ Links.

===== Specific Features on Deletion
- The semantic deletion tool doesn't perform any deletion on root _Activity_.
- The graphical deletion tool doesn't perform any deletion on root _Activity_ and _Pin_ (that are synchronized).

===== Specific Features on Graphical Drag&Drop
- All border nodes (_Pin_, _ExpansionNode_ and _ActivityParameterNode_) cannot be drag and dropped.


==== Communication Diagram

The communication diagram is a graphical description used to represent the methods of communication between objects. Communication diagrams are simplified representations of sequence diagrams focused on specific messages exchanged by lifelines. 
Note that these diagrams aren't intended to represent data manipulation involved in these transactions.

image::diagCommunication.png[Communication Diagram Overview,800, align="center"]

===== Specific Features on Label
- The label of a _Lifeline_ representing a _Property_ is the name of the _Property_ instead of the _Lifeline_ name.

===== Specific Features on Direct Edit
- The direct edit tool doesn't perform any modification on the root _Interaction_ nor _Constraint_/_Comment_ Links.

===== Specific Features on Deletion
- The semantic and graphical deletion tools don't perform any deletion on the root _Interaction_.

===== Specific Features on Edge creation
- _Messages_ can only be created between _Lifelines_ and the _Message_ orientation is displayed with an arrow on the target side of the edge. 

===== Specific Features on Graphical Drag&Drop
- No graphical drop is authorized on this diagram because there is no container node.

===== Specific Features on Semantic Drag&Drop
- A *_Type_ can be drag and dropped on the root _Interaction_* of the diagram. This creates a new semantic _Property_ typed with the dropped _Type_. A _Lifeline_ is also semantically created, representing the new _Property_ (through its _represents_ reference). Finally, the node representing the _Lifeline_ is created on the root _Interaction_ of the diagram.
- A *_Property_ can be drag and dropped on a _Lifeline_ node*. The _Lifeline_ now represents this Property (through its _represents_ reference).
- A *_Type_ can be drag and dropped on a _Lifeline_ node*. This creates a new semantic _Property_ typed with the dropped _Type_. A _Lifeline_ is also semantically created, representing the new _Property_ (through its _represents_ reference).


==== Component Diagram

The component diagram is a graphical description used to represent how components are wired together to form larger systems. These diagrams depict a high-level structural view of complex systems, and are typically used to verify that a system's required functionality is acceptable. Component diagrams are also used as communication tools between the developers and stakeholders of a system.

image::diagComponent.png[Component Diagram Overview,800, align="center"]

===== Specific Feature on Creation
- The creation of a _Port_ or _Property_ inside an untyped _Property_ is forbidden (the tool is not visible in the palette).
- The creation of a _Port_ on a _Port_ (typed and untyped) is forbidden (the tool is not visible in the palette).
- Creating a _Port_ or _Property_ inside a typed _Property_ creates a graphical element inside the _Property_ node, and a semantic element inside the _Type_ element referenced by the _type_ reference of the property.

===== Specific Features on Label
- Labels are displayed on a single line in list compartments, even when they contain a keyword.
- Label of _Ports_ with the _isConjugated_ feature set to true are displayed with the "~" prefix.


===== Specific Features on Direct Edit
- The direct edit tool doesn't perform any modification on _Generalization_ and _Link_ (from _Constraint_ or _Comment_).

===== Specific Features on Graphical Drag&Drop
- A _Property_ can be drag and dropped in a typed _Property_. This moves the semantic _Property_ inside the _Type_ element typing the containing _Property_. 

===== Specific Features on Semantic Drag&Drop
- A _Type_ can be drag and dropped on a _Port_ or a _Property_. This sets the _type_ property of the element with the dropped _Type_.


==== Deployment Diagram

The deployment diagram is a graphical description used to represent the physical deployment of a system. In this diagram, nodes represent computing resources, on which artifacts (e.g. software components) are allocated. This allocation is represented by the _Deployment_ relationship.

image::diagDeployment.png[Deployment Diagram Overview,800, align="center"]

===== Specific Features on Direct Edit
- The direct edit tool doesn't perform any modification on _Generalization_ and _Link_ (from _Constraint_ or _Comment_).

==== Portal representation

A portal can be created anywhere (on any semantic element in the project) and is just a kind of dashboard where the end-user can add other representations (of any kind) so that they can be all opened at the same time.

image::portalRepresentation.png[Portal Representation,1000, align="center"]

See https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/doc/iterations/2024.1/shapes/add_support_for_portal_representation.adoc[Portal Documentation] for more details.

==== Profile Diagram

The Profile diagram provide a way to extend an UML model. They are based on additional stereotypes (identified as classes with the «stereotype» stereotype) and labeled values that are applied to UML element thanks to the _extension_ relation.

image::diagProfile.png[Profile Diagram Overview,800, align="center"]

===== Specific Features on Label
- The label of an _ElementImport_ is the label of the UML metaclass it references as its _imported element_.

===== Specific Features on Direct Edit
- The direct edit tool doesn't perform any modification on UML metaclasses, _Generalization_ and _Link_ (from _Constraint_ or _Comment_).

===== Specific Features on Semantic Drag&Drop
- The semantic drag and drop of an _ElementImport_ with an UML metaclass as its _imported element_ on the Profile diagram produces a Node with the name of the UML metaclass as its label. Note that it is not possible to drag and drop _ElementImport_ with no _imported element_ or with an _imported element_ that is not an UML metaclass. 

===== Specific Features on Reconnection
- Reconnecting an _Extension_ target to a different _Class_ updates the _Stereotype_ property _type_.



==== UseCase Diagram

The UseCase diagram is a graphical description used to represent the different ways a user can interact with a system. Use case diagrams show the functional elements (use cases represented by ellipses), the individuals or objects that invoke these functionalities (actors shown as stick figures), and possibly the elements responsible for implementing these use cases (subjects).

image::diagUseCase.png[UseCase Diagram Overview,800, align="center"]

===== Specific Features on Direct Edit
- The direct edit tool doesn't perform any modification on _Generalization_, _PackageImport_, _PackageMerge_ and _Link_ (from _Constraint_ or _Comment_).

[[right-side-panel]]
=== Right side panel

On the right of the page, one can see several stacked views giving information about the current selection.

==== Details

The Details panel is used to visualize and edit all the features of the selected semantic object (from Explorer or diagrams). The panel is divided into 4 separate tabs:

* UML: details the main UML features of the semantic element
* Comments: displays comments associated with the selected element. Those comments can be owned by the element or applied to it (using a relation between the comment and this element).
* Profile: focus on applied stereotypes/profiles of this selected element
* Advanced: This tab displays all features of the semantic element. It uses generic rules to find the best suitable widget to visualize and edit the feature.

In the UML tab, each property is represented by an appropriated widget according to its nature. For instance, a property of type `ecore::EString` will be represented by a text widget. It might be, in some situations more appropriate to represent this string with a text area widget that supports multiple lines of text.

===== UML panel

====== Basic widgets

In the following table, we present the mapping between basic types and their associated widgets

|===
| Basic Type | Widget

| _Mono Boolean_
| _Checkbox_

| _Mono String_
| _Text field_ or _Text area_

| _Mono Number_
| _Text field_

| _Mono Enumeration_
| _Select_ or _Radio_

| _Many Boolean, String, Number, Enumeration_
| _Primitive List_

| _Many and Mono Reference_
| _Reference_
|===

Here is https://docs.obeostudio.com/{sirius-documentation-version}/help_center.html#_details_view[the Sirius documentation] of all those widgets.

Beside these standard widgets, some UML 2 concepts have properties that need a special UI to manage their data. The following sections detail of each custom widget we introduced.

====== Language Expression

A language expression custom widget has been introduced to manage a couple of connected lists in the following concepts:

* `FunctionBehavior`
* `OpaqueAction`
* `OpaqueBehavior`
* `OpaqueExpression`

All those concepts manage a couple of lists of `strings` which are weakly connected via their index. The first list, called '[.code]``languages``' contains the name of languages, such as `"JAVA"` or `pass:c["C++"]`. The second one contains the body expression expressed in the language of the same rank in the list. Thus those lists could not be edited in Papyrus UI as separate ordinary lists of text fields. This is the reason why a new custom widget has been developed.

image::languageexpression.png[language expression custom widget,400, align="center"]

The above image shows the custom widget associated with the virtual property '[.code]``language``' of a `FunctionBehavior`. The plus icon in front of the property label can be used to populate the following list by adding a predefined language or a new one. This selection of the language to add is done using a modal dialog.

Each language in the list is shown as a collapsible section with the name of the language as the title. On the right part of the header/title section, there is the section toolbar containing all actions that can be performed in this language. Once a language is expanded, the body of the language is revealed and the user can modify it. Only one language is expanded at a time. An expanded language will be automatically collapsed if the user expands another one.

Languages can be reordered using up or down actions of the toolbar. Since the list is not a ring, the user is not allowed to move up the first language or move down the last one.

Removing a language can be done using the trash icon action of its toolbar. No confirmation is required before deleting a language element.

====== Primitive List

The primitive list custom widget aims to provide capabilities to visualize and edit _EAttributes_ which represent more than one value.

image::primitive-list.png[align="center"]

The values are represented as list items.
Each item can be deleted using the _trash_ icon.
To add a value, the _New item_ input can be used.
Be aware that the server receives a _String_ value and needs to convert it to the correct _DataType_.
For widgets used in the default pages of the _Details_ view, Papyrus Web uses pure _EMF_ implementation to convert the given _String_ into the required _DataType_.
It is also possible provide a strict list of candidates for enumeration or boolean, for example.
In that case, the list of possible values are presented in a dropdown whereas the text field is used as a filter of those values.
This list of possible values is requested to the back end only when it is necessary (when the dropdown menu is presented).
In case of a _displayExpression_ is specified in the _PrimitiveList_ widget, this expression is evaluated for each candidate.
Inside this expression, the AQL variable _candidate_ can be used to refer the current candidate value. 
Once the user chooses the value, it may be added using the plus icon action.
For example, for a _boolean_ feature, there are only two value allowed _true_ and _false_.

In the context of _UML_, for a more exhaustive list of conversion rule look at:

* _org.eclipse.uml2.uml.internal.impl.UMLFactoryImpl.createFromString(EDataType, String)_
* _org.eclipse.uml2.types.internal.impl.TypesFactoryImpl.createFromString(EDataType, String)_

The primitive list has also the capability to reorder its items. This is an optional capability that is controlled by the presence of an expression inside the view model of the widget. If such an expression is provided an reorder icon appears on the left of the list title as displayed below:

image::primitive-list-with-reorder-action.png[primitive list with reorder action, 500, align="center"]

Triggering this reorder icon opens a dialog in which the user can change the order of the list items:

image::primitive-list-reorder-dialog.png[width=300, height=360, align="center"]

The primitive list custom widget can be configured to have a single extra action on each item.
This item action is optional and can be deactivated using the _PrimitiveListItemActionOperation.preconditionExpression_. 
One can control the UI appearance of the action by setting its icon file.

As an example, the following image shows a paperclip icon for the item action and when the user clicks an information pops up with the clicked item name.

image::primitive-list-with-item-action.png[primitive list with item action, 500, align="center"]

====== References

Depending on the nature of the reference, we handle it differently. 
Containment references use a dedicated custom widget, while non-containment references use Sirius components reference widgets.

Containment reference widget

In those references, reference values are child nodes of the reference owner, which means that the elements referenced in the widget can be found underneath the reference owner. 
For instance, a class that has two operations set in its `Owned Operations` property can be found as children nodes of the _Class_ node in the _Model Explorer_

image::containment-reference.png[containment reference widget, 500, align="center"]
image::containment-children.png[align="center"]

The containment reference widget has the following actions available:

 * The plus icon to change the reference value +
 It starts to create a new child element. 
 If the specified type of the reference has derived types, a modal dialog is open to choose the actual type of the new element.
 After its creation, the new element is set as the reference value in case this reference is a mono-valued one, or added to the reference value list otherwise. 
 
[WARNING]
====
In case of mono-valued containment reference, if the value is already set, the user is not allowed to create a new element and the plus icon is disabled. 
 In this situation, the user has to remove first the current value before creating a new one.
====

 * The reorder icon to sort the reference values (optional: only for multi-valued references). +
 Reordering values can be done manually inside a dedicated dialog: 

image::containment-reference-reorder-dialog.png[width=300, height=360, align="center"]

 * The cross icon on each value element to remove this value in the reference *and* delete the element from the model.
 * Clicking value elements inside the reference navigates to those elements.   

Non-containment reference widget

Non-containment references are managed using the Sirius components reference widget.

image::reference.png[non-containment reference widget, 500, align="center"]

Actions available in non-containment reference widgets are:

* Ellipsis icon to set/edit the value of the reference using a dialog:

image::reference-set-mono.png[mono-valued set, 400, align="center"]

In a mono-valued reference, the user can select a compatible element to set in the reference (this element will possibly replace the current reference value)

image::reference-set-multi.png[multi-valued edit, 600, align="center"]

Whereas in a multi-valued reference, the dialog allows the user to manage the list of reference values. 
The left panel contains compatible elements within the editing context.
Elements  displayed with a bold label are elements that are currently present in the reference value list.
This list can be seen in the right panel.
Icons in between those panels can be used to move a selected element from right to left (remove operation) or from left to right (add operation).
Moving elements can also be performed by dragging an element from a panel and dropping it to the other one.
Finally, current elements (in the right panel) can be reordered using drag and drop.

* The plus icon to create a new element and change the reference value. +
Since new element is not contained by the reference owner, user has to first specify the new element's container and the actual type of element to create.
This is done inside the create dialog:

image::reference-create.png[creation dialog, 500, align="center"]

For a mono-value reference, once the new element is created it is set as the reference value and replaces its current value.
In case of a multi-valued reference, the new element is added at the end of the value list.

* The trash icon to clear the reference value.
* The dropdown icon to choose a value among compatible elements (not already present in the reference value) found in the editing context. +
For a mono-valued reference the selected value replace the existing one, whereas it is added to the value list in case of multi-valued.
* The user can type some text in the values area to filter dropdown list content.
* Each value element has a cross icon to remove it from the reference. +
Since this is a non-containment reference, the removed element is only removed from its value and the referenced element still exists in the model.

[WARNING]
====
In some widgets the following warning message will be displayed when trying to remove an element using the cross button.

`Removing 'XXX' from 'YYY' would destroy 'ZZZ' by making it an orphan in the containment tree.`

The element is *not* removed from the list.
This security prevents you to remove the element because this would cause the deletion of the current selected item.
In most case, the currently edited reference is an _eOpposite_ of the reference that is currenlty containing the displayed element.
This is the case for the widget _Context_ on a _Constraint_.
====


* Clicking value elements inside the reference navigates to those elements. 

Rule for searching candidate values of non-containment reference

As we have seen in previous sections, the dialogs to set (or edit) value references and the dropdown collect all possible compatible values for a reference.
This is done with a dedicated UML domain service.
This service is in charge of finding all reachable elements from the element owing the reference that are compatible with the type of the reference.
The following algorithm is used to perform this search:

- Starting from the element owning the reference, all elements of the current model are reachable.
- _PackageImport_ elements found in between the element itself and the root of the model are collected.
- All imported packages of those _PackageImport_ elements and their content are reachable.
- The previous steps are recursively applied for each imported package.

[NOTE]
====
Since the above search rule is using _PackageImport_ element and its `importedPackage` reference, this rule cannot be applied to this specific reference.
Therefore, a special treatment is applied for this reference in order to compute the list of reachable _Package_ elements from a _PackageImport_ element.
In this special case, the collection of reachable elements is built by browsing all the loaded resources to collect every contained _Package_ elements.
====

[WARNING]
====
In some case, the following warning message will be displayed:

`Unable to update reference 'XXX': 'newYYY' must be an instance of ZZZ`

Or

`Unable to create 'WWW' in reference 'XXX': 'newYYY' must be an instance of ZZZ`

when creating a new element using the + button.

For most cases, it is caused by an incompatible type in an _eOpposite_ feature.
It means that the selected type is valid for editing the current reference but it has an _eOpposite_ reference that cannot contain the current element.
This is mostly caused by the use of reference type redifinition in the _UML_ metamodel (look for "redefine" _EAnnotations_).
For example, this is the case when creating an _Activity_ in widget _Owned parameter element_ on _TemplateParameter_ concept.

===== Definition panel

When a Profile element is selected (for instance inside the _Explorer_), the definition tab is shown in the Details panel.
The _Definition_ page contains all profile's version detailed information. 
These information are those typed inside the dialog each time the profile is published.

All profile definitions are stacked together with the more recent version on top of the panel. +
Each profile definition can be removed using the trash button. 

WARNING: The remove action only remove the profile definition from the model.
It does not "unpublish" the profile.

===== Comments panel

As we have already mentioned, _Comments_ panel displays for the selected element the list of owned and applied comments.
_Applied comments_ contains the list of _Comments_ that are currently annotating the selected element.

The feature _Annotated Element_ of the related _Comment_ element contains the select element.

image::annotated-element.png[Annotated element of a comment, 500, align="center"]

Both features, _Applied comments_ and _Annotated element_ work together and are in-sync.
That means that adding (or removing) an element in _Annotated element_ of a _Comment_ automatically adds (or removes) this comment to the _Applied comments_ of the element and vice-versa.
Creating a new _Comment_ from the _Applied comments_ list of selected element has two actions:

* first a new _Comment_ is created somewhere (as defined in the Creation dialog)
* next, the selected element is added inside the _Annotated element_ of this new comment to ensure that these relations are in-sync.   

===== Profile Panel

On an _Element_ selection, the _Applied Stereotype_ widget provides the capacities to:

* Apply a stereotype: Use the dropdown or start entering the name of the _Stereotype_.
* Unapply a stereotype: Use the trash icon next to the _Stereotype_ item.

If a _Package_ is selected, the _Applied profiles_ widget provides the capacities to:

* Apply a profile: Use the dropdown or start entering the name of the _Profile_.
* Unapply a profile: Use the trash icon next to the _Profile_ item.
* Update a profile: If a newer version of the profile is available, use the refresh button next to the _Profile_ item.

===== Stereotype panels

For each stereotype applied on a specific element, a dedicated tab on the _Details_ panel can be open when this element is selected.
This tab contains all the features provided by the corresponding stereotype for this element.
According to the kind of each feature, a specific widget is used to handle this feature.
In the following tables, we are presenting all kind of supported features and the associated widget to handle it in the panel.
